作为一个学术菜鸡，基本上就靠着知乎上这个回答活着了，这真的说到我心里并且想要熟读并背诵的一段话。原链接在这里，同时我把回答贴出来了，原问题是“您认为博士期间最重要的事情是什么”，希望能给到在科研路上的大家一些鼓励。
“The great advantage of being young is that, no matter what, you’ll still have opportunities if you’re prepared to work hard and be open-minded. So you should try to stay optimistic and focus on your progress. At the end of my PhD I felt reasonably confident, probably too confident, because I had developed some expertise in a somewhat difficult research area and had learned a lot of things. I hope you’ll arrive at a similar stage soon. As I probably told you before you came here, your priority as a student should be to realise your potential. Obviously everybody is different, but focusing on improving yourself is usually the safest way to be happy.”
