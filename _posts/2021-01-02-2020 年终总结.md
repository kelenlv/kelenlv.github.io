本来写了很多现在却没什么想要发出来的，年底最大的一个改变可能就是分享欲、表达欲的减少。2020经历了身心上的重大改变，不一一赘述，很高兴在2020年的尾巴逐渐找回我自己，希望2021能保持，清醒地去认识自己是谁。


分享一段之前写的唯一保留的内容，是知乎[原链接](https://www.zhihu.com/question/419282956/answer/1505087049)上让我怦然心动的一段话（原问题是**您认为博士期间最重要的事情是什么**），它给了我无限的勇气与希望，也祝福看到的各位脚下有路，心中有光。

>The great advantage of being young is that, no matter what, you’ll still have opportunities if you’re prepared to work hard and be open-minded. So you should try to stay optimistic and focus on your progress. At the end of my PhD I felt reasonably confident, probably too confident, because I had developed some expertise in a somewhat difficult research area and had learned a lot of things. I hope you’ll arrive at a similar stage soon. As I probably told you before you came here, your priority as a student should be to realise your potential. Obviously everybody is different, but focusing on improving yourself is usually the safest way to be happy.”
