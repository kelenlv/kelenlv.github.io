## Thoughts

作为一个学术菜鸡，基本上就靠着知乎上这个回答活着了，这真的说到我心里并且想要熟读并背诵的一段话。[原链接](https://www.zhihu.com/question/419282956/answer/1505087049)在这里，同时我把回答贴出来了，原问题是**您认为博士期间最重要的事情是什么**，希望能给到在科研路上的大家一些鼓励。
><i class="fas fa-hand-holding-heart"></i>“The great advantage of being young is that, no matter what, you’ll still have opportunities if you’re prepared to work hard and be open-minded. So you should try to stay optimistic and focus on your progress. At the end of my PhD I felt reasonably confident, probably too confident, because I had developed some expertise in a somewhat difficult research area and had learned a lot of things. I hope you’ll arrive at a similar stage soon. As I probably told you before you came here, your priority as a student should be to realise your potential. Obviously everybody is different, but focusing on improving yourself is usually the safest way to be happy.”
